Hello World this is my awesome message!.

DISK - READ SECTOR(S) INTO MEMORY
AH = 02h
AL = number of sectors to read (must be nonzero)
CH = low eight bits of cylinder number
CL = sector number 1-63 (bits 0-5)
high two bits of cylinder (bits 6-7, hard disk only)
DH = head number
DL = drive number (bit 7 set for hard disk)
ES:BX -> data buffer

Return:
CF set on error
if AH = 11h (corrected ECC error), AL = burst length
CF clear if successful
AH = status (see #00234)
AL = number of sectors transferred (only valid if CF set for some
BIOSes)
